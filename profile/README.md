## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This GitHub organization has no ties to Discord or its subsidiaries, this is simply to help organize the repos for this project of mine.

## What is this

This is a personal project. The aim is to have a Discord bot to quote users, when they say something funny for example, and have a place to easily manage and find the quotes you want.

## Can I join/help

I'm not looking to increase the scope and add maintainers.
This is just a passion project, and I intend for it to remain as such for the foreseeable future.
