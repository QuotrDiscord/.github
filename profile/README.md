## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This GitHub organization has no ties to Discord or its subsidiaries, this is simply to help organize the repos for this project of mine.

## What is this

This is a personal project. The aim is to have a Discord bot to quote users, when they say something funny for example, and have a place to easily manage and find the quotes you want.

## Can I join/help

I'm not looking to increase the scope and add maintainers.
This is just a passion project, and I intend for it to remain as such for the foreseeable future.

That being said, I'm open to constructive criticism to help me improve the quality of my code.
Those contributions will be credited in the `README.md` file of the corresponding repo.

You can also feel free to build on what I've started by forking the repos if you want to add features that I don't have time to implement.
